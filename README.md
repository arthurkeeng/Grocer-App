# Grocer-App
This module provides functionality for an app that helps you keep a list of things. It works sort of like a Todo app . It persists data in localstorage. Feel free to include this module in your todo app, grocery app, or any app that keeps a list.
# Please Note
This is written with javascript react, so for it to work , you'd need to install react and react-icons.
Nevertheless, you could tweak this to work whichever way you want
